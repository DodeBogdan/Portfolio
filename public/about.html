<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
  I am a passionate self-learner, I like social activities and social
  gatherings.
</p>

<p>
  Starting with 2016 I started to embrace my passion on programming and begin my
  journey by watching a video of how to create a game in Unity, then I took it
  further and tried on my own to create different ideas I had in mind.
</p>

<p>
  Staring with 2019, I participated as a voluntary in teaching kids different
  social skills and organizing different workshops.
</p>

<p>
  In my free time I like traveling, I started my journey into traveling from
  2020, when I wanted to escape my comfort zone and try new things
